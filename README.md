Anki-Headless
-------------------------------------

This is a stripped-down backend-only Anki client, to be used in conjunction w/
other frontends. Original version of Anki GUI client can be found
[here](https://github.com/dae/anki). This could be thought as an standalone
implementation of [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159).
